## Summary

The four examples outlined below form a tutorial of sort, and thus complement the rest of the package documentation. The corresponing data wrangling examples in `flow_fields.jl` define grids and ingest velocity fields. They hopefully provide a useful jumping off point in order to configure `IndividualDisplacements.jl` for new problems.

Output is in [DataFrames](https://juliadata.github.io/DataFrames.jl/latest/) tabular format which comes with powerful and convenient analysis methods. Plotting results in space and time can be done as in `recipes_plots.jl`, `recipes_makie.jl`, and `recipes_pyplot.jl` -- see the examples.

## Particle Set Example

Simulation of an ensemble of displacements (and trajectories) in a simple 2D configuration. 

The `convert_to_FlowFields` convenience function defines a simplified gridded domain that matches the velocity array size, adds a time range, and returns a `FlowFields`
data structure `ùêπ`. 
All that is left to do at this stage is to define initial conditions, put them together with `ùêπ` within the `Individuals` data structure `ùêº`, and call `‚à´!(ùêº)`.

The prototype for this example is based on a randomly generated flow field in a doubly periodic gridded domain. 
Exercises include the non-periodic domain case, statistics made easy via `DataFrames.jl`, and replacing the flow field with your own.

## Single Particle Example

Setup a three-dimensional flow field `u,v,w`, initialize a single particle / individual position `üìå`, and wrap everything up within an `Individuals` data structure `ùêº`.

`ùêº` is displaced by integrating the individual velocity, [moving along through space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_and_Eulerian_specification_of_the_flow_field), over time `ùëá`.  This is the main computation done in this package -- interpolating `u,v,w` to individual positions `ùêº.üìå` on the fly, using `ùêº.üöÑ`, and integrating through time, using `ùêº.‚à´`.

The flow field consists of [rigid body rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_body), plus a convergent term, plus a sinking term in the vertical direction. This flow field generates a downward, converging spiral -- a idealized version of a relevant case in the Ocean.

## Global Ocean Circulation

A simulation of floating particles over the Global Ocean which illustrates (1) using time variable velocity fields, (2) global connections, (3) particle re-seeding, and (4) output statistics. 

The flow field is based on a data-constrained ocean model solution. The problem is configured in a way to mimic, albeit very crudely, the near-surface tranport of plastics or planktons.

## Three Dimensional Pathways

A simulation of particles that follow the three-dimensional ocean circulation. This example illustrates (1) the 3D case in a relatistic configuration, (2) tracking the advent or origin of a water patch, and (3) multifacted visualizations in 3D.

The flow field is based on a data-constrained, realistic, ocean model. The problem configuration mimics, albeit very approximately, ocean tracers / coumpounds transported by water masses .

## Running The Examples

Running the examples requires `julia` and its relevant packages. Inputs get downloaded as needed upon running the examples. The first three steps below do this, and generate jupyter notebook versions of the examples (easy to rerun afterwards). Once everything is setup then user can just call examples directly in `julia` (i.e., skip to last step below).

#### 1. Download the examples folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/JuliaClimate/IndividualDisplacements.jl
julia --project=IndividualDisplacements.jl/docs/
```

#### 2. Get all needed packages and `IndividualDisplacements.jl`:

```
using Pkg
Pkg.activate("IndividualDisplacements.jl/docs/")
Pkg.instantiate()
Pkg.add("IndividualDisplacements")
```

#### 3. Generate jupyter notebook using `Literate.jl`:

```
using Literate
Literate.notebook("IndividualDisplacements.jl/examples/basics/solid_body_rotation.jl", ".", execute = true, documenter = false)
Literate.notebook("IndividualDisplacements.jl/examples/worldwide/three_dimensional_ocean.jl", ".", execute = true, documenter = false)
```

And so on and so forth -- see documentation for a list of examples.

#### 4. or alternatively, in the julia REPL:

```
using IndividualDisplacements
p=dirname(pathof(IndividualDisplacements))
include(p*"/../examples/worldwide/global_ocean_circulation.jl")
```

## More Examples

-  Examples reproducing trajectories that had been computed earlier in Fortran ([MITgcm/pkg/flt](https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/outp_pkgs/outp_pkgs.html#)) are `detailed_look.jl` and `particle_cloud.jl`. 
- For more examples, see: `example_CyclicArray.jl`, `example123.jl`, `helper_functions.jl`.
